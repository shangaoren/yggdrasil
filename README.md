Yggdrasil is a C++ based RTOS targeting cortex M3 and M4 microcontrollers.

This RTOS was designed to be simple to use and flexible, it aims to be a base example for those who try to understand how a RTOS works too.

If you have any remarks, advice, need some features, or else, feel free to send me a mail ;)

I would be happy to know for which project Yggdrasil was useful to you ;)

I have to thanks Thomas LEGRAND, CEO of EZNOV who gave me tips, curiosity and skills to create this RTOS,

Philippe, Matthieu and Florent for helping me when i was stuck on coding tricks

Hope you will enjoy !
